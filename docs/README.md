# EntityFrameworkCore.Jet
This project is the Entity Framework Core provider for Jet (Microsoft Access mdb and accdb file format).

This provider is mainly intended for desktop applications under .NET 4.6.1 (Console, WPF, WinForms and Services), but 
may also work under ASP.NET 4.6 and ASP.NET Core 1.0 when using the .NET Framework runtime. It does **not** currently work under 
the .NET Core runtime (netcore and netstandard).

You can find the latest build on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EntityFrameworkCore.Jet/)
